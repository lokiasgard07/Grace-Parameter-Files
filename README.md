## **Abstract**  
In the pursuit of **aesthetically pleasing and standardized data visualization**, we present **Grace-Parameter-Files**, a curated set of XMGrace parameter files designed for professional-grade graph formatting. These files ensure **consistent, clear, and Helvetica-powered** visualization, elevating research presentation standards.

## **1. Introduction**  
Data visualization is **both a necessity and an art** in scientific research. Default graph settings often lead to **inconsistent, unrefined, and reviewer-displeasing figures**. This repository provides a **structured, standardized approach** to graph aesthetics, ensuring compliance with **publication-grade visualization standards**.  

---

## **2. Methodology**  
The repository includes three parameter files for different graph layouts:  

- **`1graph.param`** → Single graph layout  
- **`2graph.param`** → Two vertically stacked graphs  
- **`3graph.param`** → Three vertically stacked graphs  

### **Key Features:**  
✔ **Helvetica font** for a professional appearance  
✔ **Fixed label sizes** for clarity  
✔ **Consistent formatting** to maintain standardization  
✔ **Optimized layouts** for research papers, reports, and presentations

## **3. Implementation**  
To apply the predefined formatting, use the following command:  

```bash
xmgrace -p 1graph.param
